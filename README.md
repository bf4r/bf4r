Working apps.

### [slap](https://github.com/bf4r/slap) (1)
A framework for simulating the real world using objects in C#. Create People, let them create other people, let them live and do actions. Everything is logged and monitored. Includes time travel!

### [az](https://github.com/bf4r/az) (1)
Flexible autonomous* and configurable AI agent. Ask it something, it will think, then respond with code, which is then executed to help solve the task and **manipulate with files** on your system. Bring your own API key.

### [dsm](https://github.com/bf4r/dsm) (1)
A custom interpreted programming language. Whitespace is ignored in this language, so you can go crazy with one-line programs. It's not readable at first, but only until you dive into the instruction map.

### [myla](https://github.com/bf4r/myla) (1)
A discord bot made in Python. Allows you to talk to AI language models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama or any other model using an OpenAI-compatible API such as [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). Configurable with Python files. Includes commands such as .ai, .aichats, .aisystem and more. Type **.help** for help.

### [clibits](https://github.com/bf4r/clibits) (6)
This is a repo containing multiple projects, often made in C#, which are small CLI programs that aren't big enough to have their own repository dedicated to them. If they become big enough, they will be given their own repository and removed from this one with a notice. Most of the projects here would probably have the code (1) or (0).

### [tush](https://github.com/bf4r/tush) (1)
A modular CLI multitool based on an old project. It relies on `bash` and doesn't work without it. It contains a collection of modules (which you can create too) that contain bash scripts that do specific things. Features aliases and an interactive mode for executing these modules as well as help pages for each and built-in tooling around said modules.

### [medit](https://github.com/bf4r/medit) (1)
Medit is a minimal CLI text editor written in C#. It's not designed to be user-friendly and uses some unusual bindings. You can write and save text files in it, which is the bare minimum a text editor has to do.

## 5
Toy projects!

### [living-room](https://github.com/bf4r/living-room) (5)
A 3-dimensional living room in a JavaScript web page. It features some custom Three.js models such as a bookshelf, chair, table, sofa and computer. It has a giant TV screen to which you can share any window (e.g. YouTube) and watch it in the living room. If you turn on the computer, a program containing the living room itself will appear. It's a first-person experience.

### [easy-flux](https://github.com/bf4r/easy-flux) (5)
An old script. A single file which serves as an easier interface with the Replicate API for using the FLUX.1 pro, dev and schnell models. Bring your own API key and use the `python flux.py` command with parameters to easily receive fast images from FLUX.1 running on Replicate's servers.
